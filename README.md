# Signal Retros

Non-confidential reflections, heuristics, and patterns from building **Signal** — Bain’s internal collaboration & M&A planning platform powering enterprise-scale post-merger execution.

This repo is *conceptual* — not code. It’s a place where I’m codifying the “why” behind workflows:

- where collaboration actually breaks
- how knowledge *actually* gets lost in motion
- what “decision latency” looks like in the wild
- the patterns that repeatedly showed up across industries

## Themes

**1) Structured collaboration**
- asynchronous alignment > more meetings  
- artifacts as the “API surface” between teams

**2) Enterprise adoption = friction removal**
- small wins → reduced cognitive load → compounding usage  
- irreversible → irreversible transition states matter

**3) AI only helps when the inputs are clean**
- retrieval + constraints beats “magic”  
- human workflows define the model, not the other way around

## What to expect here

I’ll be dropping short essays + diagrams over time:
- “why execs don’t read dashboards”
- “removing the 3 heaviest objects in a workflow”
- “the power of opinionated defaults”

Small, tight, useful.

## Why this exists

Because shipping product generates tacit knowledge.  
This repo is me making some of it explicit.
